This project is an AI-powered chatbot designed to answer questions about a collection of insurance contracts. It leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to provide accurate, context-aware answers. The user interacts with the AI through a clean web interface built with Streamlit.

The system first generates a set of synthetic contract documents, then indexes them for efficient semantic search, and finally uses an OpenAI model with tool-calling capabilities to retrieve relevant information before formulating a response.
