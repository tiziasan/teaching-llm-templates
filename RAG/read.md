This project demonstrates a complete workflow for semantic text analysis. It uses BAAI/bge-m3 embedding model to convert a corpus of sentences into numerical vectors.

Including (i)Semantic Search: Calculates cosine similarity to find and rank sentences that are most semantically relevant to a user-defined query. (ii)Interactive Visualization: Uses t-SNE for dimensionality reduction and Plotly to create a 2D scatter plot, allowing for visual exploration of sentence clusters. The user's query is highlighted on the plot to show its position relative to the other sentences.
